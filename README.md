Problem:
Having trouble finding rooms/places on campus. Google Maps can show you the building, but specific rooms are hard to find. Being late or having to ask people to find a place is inconvenient.

Solution:
A map app is sold to companies and universities. It scans all rooms/buildings and gives directions for people to get to a specific room. Uses voice speech for accessibility and has add-on features. People can report (locked doors, wet floor, hazards, etc.) to help pick routes. In case ofan emergency, AI tracks the source and picks an evacuation route that avoids that area.

How does this connect to truth and service?
Projects should demonstrate how AI can support transparency, equity, access, or community well-being—while thoughtfully addressing the ethical and societal implications of the technology.
